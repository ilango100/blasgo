# BLASGo

BlasGo is a wrapper library providing [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/#_blas_routines) functions in Go. 

BlasGo tries to bring blas functions to Go, providing optimizations where possible. BlasGo needs other "BLAS" C libraries (OpenBLAS, ATLAS, etc.) to link against.

Pure Go implementation of BLAS is **not** currently available.

This is a **Work in Progress**.
